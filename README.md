=> Used Postman to test MongoDB CRUD endpoints.  

## Day 6 (Monday, 28-07-2025)
=> Introduction to SQL and Relational Databases.  
=> Understood differences between SQL vs NoSQL.  
=> Learnt basic SQL syntax: CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.  
=> Created basic tables for Students, Courses, and Enrollments.  
=> Understood primary keys, foreign keys, and data types (VARCHAR, INT, BOOLEAN).  
=> Used NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and DEFAULT constraints.  

## Day 7 (Tuesday, 29-07-2025)
=> Deep dive into SQL data types - VARCHAR, TEXT, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, etc.  
=> Practiced altering tables and modifying column types (ALTER TABLE).  
=> Learnt about ENUM type in PostgreSQL and case sensitivity issues.  
=> Explored TRUNCATE vs DELETE vs DROP with examples.  
=> Understood the use of ON DELETE CASCADE in foreign keys.  
=> Practiced writing queries for table relationships (JOIN-like logic).  
=> Discussed differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL.  

## Day 8 (Wednesday, 30-07-2025)
=> Reviewed SQL commands and practiced real-life table relationships.  
=> Created and tested foreign key constraints with ON UPDATE / ON DELETE actions.  
=> Learnt about BOOLEAN in PostgreSQL and valid input values (true, false, not 'YES', 'NO').  
=> Explored indexing basics and why PRIMARY KEY implies indexing.  
=> Practiced writing SELECT queries with WHERE, LIKE, and ORDER BY.  
=> Created a small relational data model involving students, courses, and enrollments with real data entries.
